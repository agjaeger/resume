		{Stair Climbing Robot, High School Thesis}
		{}
		{Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts}
		{January 2013 - Feburary 2014}
	\begin{itemize}
		\resitem{
			Designed a Stair Climbing Robot to aid personnel as my 
			end of term project (thesis). Presented at the 2014 
			FIRM Competition. I recieved second place in the 
			Mechanical Engineering portion.
		}
		\resitem{
			Worked with Carl Frank and Nicholas Seward to design this 
			robot in Autodesk Inventor. Used a workshop to construct using 
			wood and 3D printing. Used a Raspberry Pi and Arduino to 
			drive the robot. The Raspberry Pi handled communication and 
			preiphials. The Arduino handled the drivetrain and recieved 
			commands from the Raspberry Pi.
